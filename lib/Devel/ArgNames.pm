=head1 NAME

Devel::ArgNames - Figure out the names of variables passed into @_

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	use Devel::ArgNames;

	sub foo {
		warn "foo() called with arguments: "
			. join(", ", map { defined() ? $_ : "<unknown>" } arg_names(@_) );
	}

	foo($bar, $gorch, $blah[4]);	

=head1 DESCRIPTION

When print-debugging code, you will often ind yourself going:

	print "\$foo is $foo, \$bar is $bar"

With this module, you can write a reusable subroutine easily:

	sub my_print_vars {
		my %vars;

		@vars{arg_names(@_)} = @_;

		foreach my $var ( keys %vars ) {
			warn "$var is $vars{$var}\n";
		}
	}

	my_print_vars($foo, $bar);

This module doesn't provide dumping facilities because there are too many to
choose from. This is a DIY kit ;-)

=head1 EXPORTS

=over 4

=item arg_names @_, [ $level ]

This function will return the names associated with the variables found on
C<@_>, at the level $level. If C<$level> is not provided C<arg_names>'s
caller's caller will be used (C<<$level == 2>> in that case).

Note that you B<MUST> pass in C<@_> every single time. There is no way to get the
original aliases to the values using L<Devel::Caller> or
L<Devel::Caller::Perl>. Commits welcome!
